# IT Capstone Project

## Capstone

Capstone is a required class for senior students at Kennesaw State University. The class is built around a semester long project that has students working in teams attempting to learn and apply real world skills. 

## This Capstone Project

This capstone project in particular is Information Technology, and had us creating a security solution for a small business. We had to create and host a web server for this theoretical small business and create a security solution to apply to it, comrpised of open source security softwares. The project is broken up into milestones.

The server ran on Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 8.4.

## Sponsor and Teacher

This Capstone class is taught and cooridinated Dr. Ying Xie and our project sponsor was Dr. Lei Li.

## Team Members

Our team members are: Jessica Casasola, Craig Englert, Charles Pegram, James Vesper, and Phuc Nguyen.

# Milestones

## Milestone 1

We began the project by deciding what kind of website we would want to have. Once we decided that we would want to build an e-commerce website, we began to look for an open source template we could use. From there we planned out how and when we would be doing for the project by creating the Gantt chart. The first one made was very tentative to what it would really end up looking like in the end. We even began to work on tasks from the second milestone on accident before our sponsor let us know what we had to do for the first milestone.

The next step was for us to get the website up and running on our server. We all had to download a VPN to be able to get onto our server and once we all had played with it to get used to it we tried to get the website on it. We tinkered with the template we found and added more details to it so that it could look like an actual business website for Comfy Corner (the name we decided to give the fake company). Once the HTML file was finished, we uploaded it onto our server.


## Milestone 2

During our second milestone we had to research various security tools we could use to implement onto our server to protect the business website. Once we had deduced the list to the best options for our project we began the implementation stage. We chose the Avast antivirus, Fail2ban IPS, Tripwire IDS, and the Red Hat firewall since they were all open source and fit our budget but also due to the size of our server/business webpage, we didn't need anything more. We also changed the server passwords in case of any brute force attacks from outside users. We researched the best options for password security and came up with a 16 digit long phrase with upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters. Once we had implemented all our software onto the server we accomplished all the goals we had for our second milestone.

## Milestone 3

For the third and final milestone, we were given the task to test another teamâ€™s server for any vulnerabilities it may have had. The same thing was done with our server in which another team received our IP address and began to test it for vulnerabilities. After almost two weeks later we received notice that the other team had finally gotten through what we believe was our security defenses. There was good news and bad news within the report; the bad being that they did manage to get into our server through a form of social engineering/phishing, the good being that our security tools/software worked as intended against attacks. If not for the human made error, our server was found to be completely secure and the opposing team made sure to note that in our vulnerability report.
